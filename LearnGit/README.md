# Water Gun Projects - Learning Git

All Git related learning files will go here

## Getting Started

All members of Squirtle Squad Studio will learn to make a change to this 
README in order to include our names.

## Steps

1. Before making any changes to this README, make sure to "check-out" the branch
that we will be using to make README changes: (use the "readme" branch)

```
git checkout readme
```

2. Next, make sure to have all the updated changes on this branch:

```
git pull origin master
```

3. Now, you are ready to make changes to the README file! Open it up in your
favorite text editor and add your name to the bottom of this file and save!
